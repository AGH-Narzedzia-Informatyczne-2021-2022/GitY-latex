\subsection{Short text}
    British shorthairs are an easygoing breed of cat. They have a \underline{stable character} and take well to being kept as \underline{indoor-only} cats, making them \textbf{ideal} for apartment living. They are not terribly demanding of attention, though they will let their owner know if they feel like playing. They are \underline{not hyperactive} cats, preferring to sit close to their owners rather than on them. They might supervise household activities from a comfortable perch or perhaps the floor. \par
    \textbf{British shorthairs are \emph{wonderful} cats for people who work}, as they are very happy to simply laze around the house while their owner is out. They \emph{do not get destructive} or need other animals for company, though they do enjoy having another British shorthair or a cat with similar temperament around. \par
    As you can see in the figure \ref{fig:cat}, these cats are very beautiful. \par
    Table \ref{table:food} shows how much should they eat.
